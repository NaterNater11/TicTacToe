My final project for CPSC 101 was a tic-tac-toe game built with PyGame using a coin flip, buttons, and bots.

    Libraries Used

1.) Random (built into Jupyter)
Generates random used that would be used for bots and the coin

2.) Time (built into Jupyter)
Delayed code so visuals stay longer

3.) PyGame (pip install pygame or pip3 install pygame)
